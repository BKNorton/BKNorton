  About Me
</h1>

<p>
  My name is Brandon Norton but I go by my middle name Kirk. I am a software developer trying to find my first job within my field.
  
  I have taken some college courses in Java and have continued to learn on my own and through other alternative courses for the last four years.
  
  I have completed certificates in Software Development and UX Design at Code Louisville.

  I currently work as a Signal Support Systems Specialist for the US Army National Guard

  I love to learn new technologies and to be creative and build things. I am currently learning how to build video games in the Unity engine. It's 
  a hobby right now but I hope one day to share my games with the world. I have a lot of ideas I would like to bring to life.
